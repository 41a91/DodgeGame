- Create a Map class
    - Need to create an XML setup for determining map data 
        - size, tiles, ect

- How can I control the camera?
- Get a player spawned in and moving
- Design network packet setup
- Design generic enemy setup

- Player Movement
    - I'm going to have to rewrite how the player movement works in order to incorporate rotation mechanics
    - The movement needs to update the velocity frame, maybe I can manipulate the position directly?
